# Elite-101-Coding-Assessment-2025
Presentation Format:
This quick presentation is just to highlight the work you’ve done on your chatbot, both from the pre-work and from the work we did in class with the different scenarios
What you should talk about/show:
What the focus of your chatbot was
What was one challenging aspect of the code
What else you would do in order to improve or finish this project
If it is working, a quick demo of your chatbot
[Optional] Any extras you’ve added (unit tests, sentiment analysis, etc.)
Each of you  will  have 2-4 minutes to present.
